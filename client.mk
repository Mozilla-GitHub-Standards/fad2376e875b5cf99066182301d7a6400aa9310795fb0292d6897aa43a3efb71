# The next release version of the extension.  When building for the rel channel,
# make will use this value verbatim.  But when building for the dev channel,
# it will append a string to this value that makes the version be less than
# the future release version but greater than any previous dev version.
# For example, if the next release version is 1.4, a dev version for it might be
# 1.4x0d200909191530, where "x0d" is required by a peculiarity of Mozilla's
# version comparator (nsIVersionComparator) and the rest of the string is
# a timestamp.
