# XXX Is there a better way to localize the attribution string?  Perhaps we

# could stick the content in an XHTML file that gets localized, and then we

# could load the localized version in an iframe inside the About dialog?

# LOCALIZATION NOTE: The attribution string is static but includes links

# to the icons and licenses it references, so we use a property to construct it.

#   %1$S = link to the silk icon set

#   %2$S = link to the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License

#   %3$S = link to the OPML Icon Project

#   %4$S = link to the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 License

contributors1=D'autres icônes proviennent de %1$S, utilisant la licence %2$S. L'icône OPML provient de %3$S, avec la licence %4$S.
#contributors2       = The OPML icon is from %1$S, licensed under a %2$S.

# XXX Should any of these be localized, or is it important to use their

# original names?

# LOCALIZATION NOTE: These URLs are here because it seems better than

# hardcoding them in the script that constructs the attribution string,

# but they probably shouldn't be localized (unless perhaps the pages

# referenced have localized versions).
