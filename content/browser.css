/* Temporarily disable the river tab's background color, as it is being
 * applied inconsistently across OSes and active/inactive tabs.  In particular,
 * on Mac OS X it applies only to a Snowl tab that is inactive, and it's
 * so bright that it stands out, which makes it look like the active tab
 * rather than an inactive one.  On Ubuntu Linux it doesn't appear at all.
 * This probably needs to be OS-specific to cope with varying -moz-appearance
 * overrides and fit into overall OS-specific browser styling. */
