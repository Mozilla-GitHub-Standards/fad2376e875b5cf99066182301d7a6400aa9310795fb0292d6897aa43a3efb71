/* This box must be flexible or have an explicit width or maximum width
 * in order for its content to wrap.  In theory, the best option would be
 * a flexible width, but Mozilla doesn't wrap URLs in text until the path
 * portion of the URL, which makes the middle column too wide when we use
 * a flexible width and one of the messages contains a URL with a long hostname,
 * so instead we specify an explicit width that we update dynamically
 * as the width of the sidebar changes. */

/* This box must be the same width as its container or it'll remain as wide
 * as the width of its widest word, creating uneven widths between messages
 * once the sidebar becomes narrower than the width of any word. */

/* We don't have to update this box's width dynamically, but if we don't,
